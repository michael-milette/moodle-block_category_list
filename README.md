# Basic Overview

The Category List plugin for Moodle displays a list of top level categories.

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Requirements

This plugin requires Moodle 3.5 or 3.6 from https://moodle.org .

If you roll it back to the Initial Commit using Git, it may work with previous versions of Moodle all the way back to Moodle 2.7 but was only tested with Moodle 3.0. If it works for you, let us know. Tip: You might need to modify the version.php in order for Moodle to let you install it on earlier versions than 3.0.

## Contributors

Michael Milette - block_category_list
Martin Dougiamas - Author and Lead Developer of the block_course_list plugin upon which this is based.

## Pending Features

Eventually I would like to see a configurable setting added to the course_list plugin making this plugin obsolete.

If you would like to see this happen as well, consider contributing or hiring us to accelerate development.
